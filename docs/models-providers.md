# Models & providers

whip is provider-agnostic by construction: any OpenAI-compatible endpoint is
a provider, models route to providers, and the model catalog is discovered
live — there is no registry to update when a new model ships.

## Routing model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U["you: -m kimi-k3-fast -p inference<br/>or /model <name> [provider]"] --> RESOLVE

    subgraph RESOLVE["resolution order"]
        direction TB
        A["1. config entry for the model<br/>(authoritative override)"]
        B["2. provider catalog cache<br/>~/.whip/models.json (24h TTL)"]
        C["3. GET /models refresh<br/>if TTL expired or /model refresh"]
        A --> B --> C
    end

    RESOLVE --> P["provider<br/>baseUrl + api key + api flavor"]
    P --> API["OpenAI-compatible<br/>chat completions, streamed"]
```

- A model lists the providers that serve it (`"models": {"kimi-k3-fast":
  {"providers": ["inference"]}}`), so switching providers doesn't touch the
  model name.
- **Catalog models need no config entry.** Any model advertised by a
  provider's `GET /models` is usable directly; config entries are overrides
  when present.
- If several providers advertise the same id, pass a provider
  (`-p` / `/model <name> <provider>`) to disambiguate.
- Newly announced models appear in the `/model` picker dimmed, marked
  `(new)`, after `/model refresh` or the next TTL cycle.
- **Retry-on-miss at startup.** If launch-time resolution reports an unknown
  model — the default model has no config entry and the cached catalog is
  missing or stale (deleted `~/.whip/models.json`, or a model announced after
  the last fetch) — whip synchronously force-refreshes the configured
  providers' catalogs and retries resolution once before failing. The happy
  path never pays for this: a successful first resolve performs no fetch, so
  normal and offline starts are unaffected. Applies to every entrypoint
  (`whip`, `whip run`, `whip acp`); a genuinely unknown model still errors,
  after exactly one refresh attempt.
- `/model` persists the switch as the saved default. `/model-for-session`
  switches the active model identically but leaves the saved default
  untouched, so the next launch still opens on the configured model.

## Key resolution

Per provider, in order:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    E["apiKeyEnv<br/>env var"] --> K["apiKey<br/>literal in config"] --> I["~/.inf/config.json<br/>(inference.net only, minted by inf CLI)"]
```

First hit wins. No key material ever lives in the session store.

## OpenRouter: one key, every model

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) is an OpenAI-compatible gateway: a
single key reaches its whole catalog (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta,
DeepSeek, …) through `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`. whip's catalog-model
resolution means none of those models need a config entry — register the
provider once and `/model` lists everything, with context windows, vision
flags, and per-token pricing carried from OpenRouter's `GET /models`.

The one-command setup (also available in-session as `/auth openrouter`):

```sh
whip auth openrouter            # masked prompt for the key
whip auth openrouter sk-or-…    # key as an argument
whip auth openrouter --env      # store apiKeyEnv: OPENROUTER_API_KEY instead
```

What it does, in order:

1. **Validates the key** against the live OpenRouter API. A rejected key
   writes nothing — no provider entry, no catalog.
2. **Upserts the `openrouter` provider** into `~/.whip/config.json` (atomic,
   clobber-guarded `config.Save`; every other provider and model route is
   untouched). By default the key is stored as a literal `apiKey` (config is
   `0600`); `--env` records `apiKeyEnv: OPENROUTER_API_KEY` instead and
   offers to append the export to your shell rc.
3. **Pre-fetches the catalog** into `~/.whip/models.json`, so the very next
   `/model` picker lists the full OpenRouter catalog without waiting for the
   24h TTL refresh.

Then use any model by its OpenRouter id:

```
/model openai/gpt-5                 # picker: type to filter; (new) = newly announced
/model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5  # direct switch, provider inferred from the catalog
whip -m deepseek/deepseek-v4        # same from the CLI
```

Inside a running session, `/auth openrouter` (bare) opens a masked key
prompt — the key never echoes, never enters input history, and never lands
in the transcript. Re-running `/auth` or `whip auth` with a fresh key
re-keys in place, including the live session's routing when it's already on
the openrouter provider.

Per-model overrides still compose: add an entry under `"models"` in
config.json (with `"providers": ["openrouter"]`) to pin context, maxOut,
vision, or sampling params for a specific id.

To let OpenRouter fail over to other models, set their ids in priority order:

```json
{
  "defaultModel": "openai/gpt-5",
  "fallbackModels": [
    "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
    "google/gemini-2.5-pro"
  ]
}
```

Whip keeps `model` as the primary request field and emits this list as
OpenRouter's `models` field. OpenRouter advances through the list only when the
primary or an earlier fallback returns an eligible model/provider error. For a
single headless run, `-fallback-models id1,id2` overrides the configured list.

## Token bookkeeping

Three numbers with distinct meanings:

| Field | Meaning | Drives |
|---|---|---|
| `context` | model's **input** window | header % full, proactive compaction threshold |
| `maxOut` | optional **output** cap | request `max_completion_tokens` |
| `samplingParams` | optional `{temperature, top_p}` knobs | sent on outbound requests for this model; omitted when unset |
| provider `context_length` | advertised limit | overrides `context` when present |

The old `maxTokens` field still parses (it always meant the context window)
but is superseded by `context`. A model whose config entry sets
`"samplingParams": {"temperature": 0.2}` sends those params on every request
to that model; unset params are omitted so the provider applies its defaults.

## Cost tracking

When the provider advertises `pricing` in `GET /models`, the status line
shows session spend: `llm.Usage` (prompt/completion/cached) comes off each
streamed response, cached input is billed at the cache-read rate, and totals
accumulate per session. Hidden entirely when pricing isn't advertised.

## Compaction model

Compaction summarizes with a separate, cheaper model:
`compactModel`/`compactProvider` in config, defaulting to
`deepseek-v4-flash-0731` (`config.DefaultCompactModel`), falling back to the
conversation's own model. `/compact <model> [provider]` picks the summarizer
by hand. Mechanics: [agent-loop.md](agent-loop.md#compaction).
